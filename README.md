# Morse_Code_Arduino
This exercise will show you how to turn your Arduino into a Morse Code blinking and beeping machine! We will combine our blinking and beeping skills to accomplish this. Note the alphabet lookup table implemented with the switch case statements. The message is also echoed to the serial terminal in real time, synchronized to the flashes, and beeps.
